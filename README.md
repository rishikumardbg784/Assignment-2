### 2. Check If a Number Is Even or Odd
**File:** `num1.py`

This script prompts the user to enter a number and determines if the number is even or odd.

#### How It Works
- Prompts the user for input.
- Uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
- Prints "The number is even" if the remainder is 0.
- Prints "The number is odd" otherwise.
